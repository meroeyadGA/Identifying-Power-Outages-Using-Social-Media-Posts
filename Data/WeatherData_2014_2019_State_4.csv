A tremendous amount of moisture lifted north of the low track and into southern Michigan. This moisture combined with arctic air plunging into the Great Lakes quickly turned light rain into all snow. Intensification of this storm system during the morning of the 12th lead to the development of heavy wet snow. The strength of the storm system and instability in the atmosphere also triggered some thunder snow. During the course of the morning, northerly winds gusted between 35 to 45 mph, which caused a significant amount of blowing and drifting of the snow. These northerly winds also caused temperatures to plummet during the course of the afternoon. The rapid freezing of the heavy wet snow and blowing and drifting led to extremely poor road conditions throughout most of Southeast Michigan. The significant blowing and drifting of the snow made measuring very difficult. Snowfall accumulations generally ranged from 5 to 9 inches along and south of I-69 corridor, with isolated 10 inch amounts.

A weak, disorganized circulation touched down over an open field southwest of the intersection of Bibbins and Mosherville Roads and moved northeast. As it progressed NE it strengthened somewhat after crossing Bibbins Road and approaching a residence on Mosherville. The main circulation passed to the NW of the home, causing tree damage. The tornado appears to have quickly weakened and likely dissipated as it approached a grove of trees and a farm to the east. The remnant winds took a direct hit on a barn that was resting higher than surrounding buildings, essentially destroying it. Yet most surrounding building suffered minimal damage.

A thin layer of warm air well above the ground was able to melt snowflakes, but surface temperatures in the lower 20s resulted in freezing rain and sleet rather than just plain rain.

The winter storm featured two main rounds of heavier snow, separated by a 2-3 hour period of light freezing rain and sleet mainly south of Interstate 96. The freezing rain was enough to coat vehicles in a thin layer of ice. No significant power outages were noted. The freezing rain and sleet occurred from late morning into early afternoon as the low pressure center tracked closest to Michigan. A thin layer of warm air well above the ground was able to melt snowflakes, but surface temperatures in the lower 20s resulted in freezing rain and sleet rather than just plain rain. The atmosphere sufficiently cooled by mid afternoon and changed the precipitation back to all snow. A significant burst of heavy snow during the afternoon hours brought traffic to a crawl.  This resulted in hundreds of school closings on March 1st and 2nd.",219627042,ALPENA (ZONE), ,3/1/16,1100,11:00,2016-03-01  11:00:00 | Michigan,Winter Storm, , ,0,0,0,0,Michigan,EST-5, ,104683,Z,24,APX,0,0,Official NWS Observations, , , , , , , , , , , , ,,"Low pressure moved up the Ohio Valley on the evening of the 1st.
